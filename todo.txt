- [x] Camera controls (WASD, mouse, shift, space, etc)
- [x] Draw grid (maybe in XY, XZ, YZ planes; or just XZ plane)
    - [x] Use depth to get objects drawn in the right order
    - [x] Anti-alias
      - [ ] Better anti-alias (to fix curvy Moire patterns)
- [ ] Fix this bug: when you focus on another window (Super+h) and then focus back on the game without
      clicking on it (Super+l), it behaves as if the glfw mouse mode is HIDDEN instead of RAW (i.e. the mouse
      cursor can leave the screen when you're trying to move the camera around).
- [ ] Place and remove cubes
    - [x] Render multiple cubes
	- [ ] Raycast onto grid
- [ ] Highlight cube you're currently looking at
	- [ ] Draw outlines on cubes
- [ ] Simple terrain generation
- [ ] Fog and volumetric lighting
- [ ] Fire physics


Consider (not very important):
    Instead of attach/detach to surface, maybe the RenderResources interface should just be "setResolution".
    Or something like that.
