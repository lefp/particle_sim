# current work
- [ ] Remove every instance of `MAX_EXPECTED_SWAPCHAIN_IMAGE_COUNT`
For SurfaceResourcesImpl::
    VkImage* swapchain_images
    VkImageView* swapchain_image_views
    VkSemaphore* swapchain_image_acquired_semaphores
    - [x] malloc them in attachSurfaceToRenderer
    - [x] free them in detachSurfaceFromRenderer
    - [x] do whatever you need to in updateSurfaceResources
For RenderResourcesImpl:
    - [ ] Replace the PerSwapchainImageStuff thing with PerFrameStuff
