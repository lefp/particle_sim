# current work
- [x] Remove every instance of `MAX_EXPECTED_SWAPCHAIN_IMAGE_COUNT`
For SurfaceResourcesImpl::
    VkImage* swapchain_images
    VkImageView* swapchain_image_views
    VkSemaphore* swapchain_image_acquired_semaphores
    - [x] malloc them in attachSurfaceToRenderer
    - [x] free them in detachSurfaceFromRenderer
    - [x] do whatever you need to in updateSurfaceResources
For RenderResourcesImpl:
    - [x] Replace the PerSwapchainImageStuff thing with PerFrameStuff
- [x] Modify the RenderResourcesImpl modification logic in <attach/detach>SurfaceToRenderer


New things to deal with in RenderResourcesImpl:
- [x] last_used_frame_idx
    - [x] Initialize in createRenderResources
    - [x] Update when rendering
    - [x] Do we ever need to reset to 0? Maybe when detaching or attaching a surface?
          No, pretty there shouldn't be any difference between the two sets of resources.
- [x] render_target
    - [x] initialize on attach
    - [x] destroy on detach
- [x] render_target_view
    - [x] initialize on attach
    - [x] destroy on detach
- [x] render_target_allocation
    - [x] initialize on attach
    - [x] destroy on detach

In `render()`:
    - [x] transition swapchain image to LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR
    - [x] copy color image to swapchain image
    - [x] transition color image to COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL


Consider (not very important):
    Instead of attach/detach to surface, maybe the RenderResources interface should just be "setResolution".
    Or something like that.
