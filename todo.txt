- [x] Camera controls (WASD, mouse, shift, space, etc)
- [x] Draw grid (maybe in XY, XZ, YZ planes; or just XZ plane)
    - [x] Use depth to get objects drawn in the right order
    - [x] Anti-alias
      - [ ] Better anti-alias (to fix curvy Moire patterns)
- [ ] Fix this bug: when you focus on another window (Super+h) and then focus back on the game without
      clicking on it (Super+l), it behaves as if the glfw mouse mode is HIDDEN instead of RAW (i.e. the mouse
      cursor can leave the screen when you're trying to move the camera around).
- [ ] Place and remove cubes
    - [x] Render multiple cubes
    - [x] Raycast onto cubes
    - [ ] Raycast onto grid
- [x] Highlight cube you're currently looking at
    - [x] Draw outlines on cubes
        - [ ] Anti-alias
- [ ] Select multiple cubes (e.g. right-click, or click+drag), modify all of their properties at the same time
    - [ ] Delete key deletes
    - [ ] Under the `selection` tab, have a color picker to modify their color.
- [x] Shader hot-reloading
    - [x] Better logging
    - [x] Error-handling (e.g. failure to compile a shader should not abort the program)
    - [x] UI button to disable file-watch based shader auto-reload
    - [ ] IMPORTANT: clean up all the hot-reloading code, and rethink and unfuck the awful organization.
- [ ] Stress-test ray-cube interesction on 100k - 1M cubes, and optimize as needed.
    - [ ] Check if frustum-culling first helps.

- [ ] Simple terrain generation
- [ ] Fog and volumetric lighting
- [ ] Fire physics

- [x] Try on-demand Tracy profiling, so it doesn't consume ever-growing memory when you're not trying to get a profile.

- [ ] Fluid sim: render, for debugging purposes:
    - [ ] spheres or circles around particles showing the interaction radius
    - [ ] an rectangular-prism outline showing the simulation domain boundaries
    - [ ] a cube outline around each active cell


Consider (not very important):
    Instead of attach/detach to surface, maybe the RenderResources interface should just be "setResolution".
    Or something like that.
